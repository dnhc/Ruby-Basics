# We want to iterate through the numbers array and return a new array containing
# only the even numbers. However, our code isn't producing the expected output.
# Why not? How can we change it to produce the expected result?

=begin
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

even_numbers = numbers.map do |n|
  n if n.even?
end

p even_numbers # expected output: [2, 6, 8]
=end

# The method map returns a new array, based off of what the statements evaluate
# to. This means that in our conditional will return the number when it is even
# and nil when the statement evaluates to false. To fix this we could use a
# different method, such as select.

numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

even_numbers = numbers.select do |n|
  n if n.even?
end

p even_numbers # expected output: [2, 6, 8]
