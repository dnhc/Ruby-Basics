# In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless
# break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value
# break sets the return value to for the while loop.

# In control expressions and under break Statements, we are told that the value
# that results in the break occuring is the value that is supplied.
# However, if we do not supply a value then the break will return a nil
